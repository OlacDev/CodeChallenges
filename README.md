Code Challenges in Python, Java and JavaScript

Code Challenge 01:

The code is a simple number guessing game. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, which the player has to guess.
2. The player inputs guesses, and after each guess, the program provides feedback:
   - If the guess is too low, it tells the player it's "Too low. Try again."
   - If the guess is too high, it says "Too high. Try again."
3. When the player guesses the correct number, it congratulates the player and tells them how many attempts they made.

The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
